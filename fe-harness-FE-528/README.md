# FE-528 Harness — Technician Work Order Usage

Standalone Angular 18 harness for the **Add Usage** panel. The Work Order Details page is included only as a launching point. Uses mock data only — no API calls, no backend required.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

1. Open `http://localhost:4200`
2. Click **More** in the footer action bar
3. Tap **Add Usage**

## Features

### Launching Point: Work Order Details Page

The Work Order Details page is inherited from a prior harness and serves only as the entry point. The only relevant action here is **More → Add Usage** in the footer action bar.

### Add Usage Panel

Full-width slide-in panel for recording equipment usage. Supports two work order types (Standard and MAWO) and two entry modes (Single Entry and Multi Entry).

#### Floating Settings Panel (bottom-right corner)

The floating panel controls form behavior in real time:

| Setting | Options | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Usage Display Mode** | Meter Values Only, Business Usage Only, Business Usage and Meter Values, All Values (incl. Misc) | Controls which value fields are visible. Meter fields = start/end datetime, meter begin/end, meter validation. Business fields = business usage, individual usage, total usage. Fields like Account, Operator, Department, Task, Financial Project Code are always visible regardless of mode. |
| **Time Format** | 12 Hour, 24 Hour | Switches the Start/End Date Time pickers between 12h (hh:mm AM/PM) and 24h (hh:mm) format |
| **Work Order Type** | Standard, MAWO | Switches between Standard and MAWO mode (see below) |
| **Misc Fields** | 4 independent toggles (Misc 1–4) | Each toggle shows/hides its misc field independently. Only visible in "All Values" display mode. No blank spaces when partially enabled. |

#### Input Masking and Validation

| Field | Mask / Validation |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Hours Used** | Numbers only, max 2 decimal places (e.g., `12.50`). Same mask as meter fields. |
| **Meter Begin / End** | Numbers only, max 2 decimal places |
| **Business Usage / Individual Usage** | Numbers only, max 2 decimal places. Increment/decrement buttons (±1). |
| **Total Usage** | Read-only computed field (Business + Individual) |
| **Start / End Date** | Digits and `/` only. Validates `MM/DD/YYYY` format on blur. Invalid input is cleared and reset to the last valid value. |
| **Start / End Time** | 12h mode: digits, `:`, `A`, `M`, `P`, space. 24h mode: digits and `:` only. Validates format on blur. Invalid input is cleared. |

#### Lookup Fields (text input + search icon)

These fields allow free text entry AND have a search icon button for lookup dialogs:

| Field | Search Button Behavior |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Asset** | Opens Asset Search dialog (aw-dialog table type with search) |
| **Task** | Opens Task Lookup dialog (aw-dialog table type with 3-level drill-down, defaults to Repair Group filter) |
| **Operator** | Placeholder alert (dialog not yet implemented) |
| **Account** | Placeholder alert (dialog not yet implemented) |
| **Department** | Placeholder alert (dialog not yet implemented) |
| **Financial Project Code** | Placeholder alert (dialog not yet implemented) |

#### Section Dividers

The form uses conditional dividers to separate sections:
- Between Meter 1 and Meter 2 values
- Between Meter 2 and Business Usage (only when both sections visible)
- Between Total Usage and lookup fields (Account, Operator, etc.)
- Between Financial Project Code and Misc fields

All dividers hide automatically when their adjacent sections are not visible.

#### Standard Mode

- Single Entry (form) and Multi Entry (table) modes via segmented button
- All fields visible based on Usage Display Mode selection
- Transaction Date label

#### Meter Field Tooltips (Multi Entry Table)

In the multi-entry table, hovering over Meter 1 or Meter 2 Begin/End fields shows a native browser tooltip with the current meter reading (e.g. "Current: 45,230 miles"). This helps users reference the last known reading while entering new values. The tooltip text comes from the same hint data shown below the meter fields in the single-entry form.

> **Dev Note:** We attempted to use `AwToolTipDirective` from the CCL but it does not work reliably inside `aw-table` custom cells — the directive's event listeners get lost when the table re-renders cells. Native HTML `title` attribute is used as a fallback.

#### Conditional Meter 2 Visibility

Meter 2 fields (Begin, End, Validation) are automatically hidden when the selected asset has no second meter. This applies to both single-entry and multi-entry modes. Assets with meter 2 data (e.g. QA-FLEET-002) show all meter fields; assets without (e.g. K123-456) hide meter 2 entirely. The visibility is driven by the `hasMeter2` computed signal, which checks the asset's meter data after selection. See the MOCK-DATA-GUIDE for which assets have meter 2.

#### Auto-Add Rows (Multi Entry Table)

New rows are automatically added when the user enters data in the last row of the table — no need to click the "+ Add Row" button each time. This triggers when:
- Typing into any field on the last row
- Selecting an asset via the search dialog on the last row

Blank rows are automatically filtered out on save, so extra empty rows don't get submitted. The "+ Add Row" button remains available for users who prefer to click.

#### MAWO Mode (Multi-Asset Work Order)

When "MAWO" is selected in the Work Order Type toggle:

- **Entry mode toggle hidden** — only single-entry form is available
- **Transaction Date relabeled** to "Usage Date"
- **Hidden fields**: Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, Department, Task, Financial Project Code
- **Operator stays visible** in MAWO mode
- **Reversal toggle** (aw-toggle) appears on the same row as Hours Used
- **Children Work Orders expansion panel** appears at the bottom with:
  - Search bar (filters across asset ID, asset description, work order ID, title)
  - Work Order Status filter (defaults to "Open", options: Open, All, Work Finished)
  - Table with columns: Checkbox, Asset (ID + description), Work Order (ID + title), Status
  - Asset and Work Order columns use text/subtext rendering

### Asset Search Dialog

Table-type aw-dialog with search functionality. Select an asset and click "Go" to populate the Asset field.

### Task Lookup Dialog

Table-type aw-dialog with:
- Search bar
- Task Type filter (defaults to "Repair Group", options: Repair Group, Repair Task, PM Service, Inspection)
- 3-level hierarchical drill-down: Groups → Children → Sub-children
- Breadcrumb navigation for drill-down levels

### Theme Toggle

Dark mode toggle (moon icon, bottom-right) switches between light and dark themes.
